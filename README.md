# Happy Hour Assignment

## W1D1 - Assignment - Practice Github Classrooms

---

### Estimated Time to Complete

60 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how to implement date and time calculations in Python.
- Practice conditional statements for handling special cases (Sundays, Christmas Day, and Easter).
- Apply Python functions for simulating real-world scenarios.
- Enhance problem-solving skills by extending the functionality to include additional exceptions like Christmas Day.

---

### Assignment Overview

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the existing `happy_hour.py` code to understand its structure.
3. Add calculations for Sunday, Christmas Day, or Easter to the `is_happy_hour` function.
4. Run the modified `happy_hour.py` script to check if it correctly handles the exceptions.
5. Test different scenarios to ensure the program behaves as expected.

### How to use Assignment Repos

Let's walk through to use this type of repository?

- You will download it onto your computer. The process is the same as cloning any repo (re-watch to pre-lesson video on how to do so, or google it if you aren't sure!). 
- Once you have successfully cloned the repo onto your computer, make sure to `cd` into the cloned folder in your Command Line so you have immediate access to all the files.

- There are multiple files inside the cloned folder, but you'll only be working with one.
- Read the instructions inside of `happy_hour.py`
- Let's briefly take a look at what the function of the other files are.

![gitignore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7146649/187483324-ea53270c-be38-4306-9161-8595d6e9c436.png)

Most GitHub repos will (and should) have a `.gitignore` file. This tells your local computer what files to _ignore_ when tracking files in `git`. For instance, Mac computers create a hidden `.DS_Store` file in every folder on your computer. We can use the `.gitignore` file to make sure that those files don't end up in the GitHub repo.

_(EXTRAS: Notice how both `.gitignore` and `.DS_Store` start with a `.`? The dot tells us that these are 'hidden files', files that most users will want to ignore, so the computer hides it from us. Google how to reveal hidden files on your computer and take a look!)_

![README.md](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7146649/187484169-b84be13d-ac4f-4851-b7f0-e494a6b9173f.png)

Good GitHub repos will also have a `README.md` file, to describe what's inside the repo. You're reading this repo's `README.md` file right now! The `.md` file extension tells us that README files are written in a language called `markdown`. Take a look at the file to see the underlying characters that the browser turns into HTML when displaying it.

![happy_test.py](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7146649/187484683-1c63c05c-bf15-4686-b54d-4b4d196a7dca.png)

Good code has tests! `happy_test.py` enables you to test your code to see if it's working properly. This file will also run automatically when you turn in your homework. This means you'll be able to see how you did and make changes without waiting for us to grade it by hand. Python comes with a built-in way to write tests called [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). 


In the `happy_test.py` file, you will find unit tests for both functions. Ensure your code passes these tests by running the provided test suite.

1. From the main folder of the challenge, run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to check if your code works as expected.

   REMEMBER: Comment out or delete the calls to your functions; the tests will not run with them!

**DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE**. 

To run the tests (after you've completed the assignment):

1. Go into your **terminal**
2. Make sure you are `cd`'d into your assignment folder (you can also run the command `ls`-- if you see your `happy_test.py` file, you're in the right place)
3. Run the command `python3 -m unittest happy_test` <-- NOTE: `python3` may not be the right command on your computer. Whatever command runs Python 3 for you (`python3`, `py`, `python`), use that one and check it out! The tests will either pass (OK) or fail, in which case you should see an error that will help explain what went wrong.

Finally:

![happy_hour.py](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7146649/187496842-63c99047-00ad-4335-837e-4b1e2c8ee16e.png)

This is where _your_ code goes. Just like elsewhere, there are elements here that we won't go into _yet_, but you don't need to understand them to do the assignment. The provided code looks like this:

## Summary

0. Accept the assignment via the GitHub Classroom link (if you're already here, you've done this part!)
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in `happy_hour.py` (the only `.py` file that is not a `_test.py` file) so that it prints out the correct message.
  - Make sure to run your code often as you write it to see what changes you're making
  - 'Run' your code by typing your computer's version of `python3 happy_hour.py` into your terminal and hitting enter
3. Run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest happy_test` to see if your code works as expected
4. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code, and look for the little green check mark on your repo that tells you your tests passed

And you're good to go!
